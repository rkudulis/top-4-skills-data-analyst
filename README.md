## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

The Demand on Data Analysts is growing with the data that companies collect. The MOOC (Massive open online courses) and forums and Facebook groups are overloaded with content for beginners. I analyze job ads on Glassdoor to bring expectations and reality closer together. The main questions are what kind of hard skills are required in this field? And what's the salary expectations in the U.S.?
